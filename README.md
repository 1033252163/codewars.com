A public repository for codewars.com, where issues can be tracked and wiki documentation can be contributed to.

## When to log an issue

If the issue is related specifically to the execution of code (Test Frameworks, test output, etc) then a better place to log would be within the [Codewars Runner CLI repository](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli/issues). 

If you are looking to express an interest in adding a new feature to Codewars, you may do so here. Please be sure to check that it hasn't been logged already.
