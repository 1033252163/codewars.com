title: Igloo
language: cpp

intro: |-
  BDD style unit testing framework [Igloo](http://igloo-testing.org/) can be used to test C++ code.

basic_setup: |-
  ```cpp
  int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  ```cpp
  Describe(basic_tests)
  {
    It(should_add_numbers)
    {
      Assert::That(add(1, 1), Equals(2));
    }
  };
  ```

assertions_desc: |-
  An assertion in Igloo is written using the following format:

  ```cpp
  Assert::That(actual_value, <constraint expression>);
  ```

  where `<constraint expression>` is an expression that
  `actual_value` is evaluated against when the test is executed.

  See [Igloo Assertions](http://igloo-testing.org/assertions.html) for the list of available expressions.
